# File Sorter

This Python script sorts files into folders based on their names. The files are expected to follow a naming convention where underscores (`_`) separate folder names, and the last segment is the actual file name. The script will create directories as needed and move files to their respective directories.

## Features

- Automatically creates directories based on file names.
- Moves files to their corresponding directories.
- Handles any number of directory levels.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `shutil` (Standard Library)
